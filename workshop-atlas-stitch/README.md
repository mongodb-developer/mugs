# MongoDB Atlas & MongoDB Stitch Workshop

## Objectives

In this workshop, you will discover more about MongoDB Atlas, the Database as a Service (DBaaS) by MongoDB and MongoDB Stitch,
the serverless platform which can be used to build different things like a REST API on top of your MongoDB clusters,
interconnect MongoDB with AWS or Twilio services for example, host a frontend or build a mobile application while enforcing
security rules.

## Prerequisites

- None. Your awesome organizer will present you the basics of MongoDB with this [slide deck](https://www.slideshare.net/MaximeBeugnet/mongodb-meetup-139633820). 30-45 minutes.
- You will need about 2 hours to complete this workshop.
- I highly encourage you to be curious, to dig a bit more the around the features and options in workshop and of course ask questions!

## Let's do it

### MongoDB Atlas

First, you will need to create a [MongoDB Replica Set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/) using MongoDB Atlas.

- Go to https://www.mongodb.com/meetatlas and setup a new MongoDB Atlas account.
- Follow the *Build a New Cluster* form and create a MongoDB Free Tier cluster (M0) which is free forever.
- An M0 cluster has 512MB of storage and runs on our shared infrastructure designed for non-production workloads.
- Wait for a few minutes for the cluster to be ready to use.
- Meanwhile, have a look to the tabs on the left: 
  - Alerts,
  - Backup,
  - Access,
  - Settings.
- When your cluster is ready, load the sample dataset using the menu.
 
![Load Sample Dataset](images/load-sample-dataset.png)
 
- Click on your cluster and familiarize yourself with the different tabs:
  - Connect - where you can get the MongoDB URI to connect with the command line, your application, MongoDB Compass or the BI
  Connector.
  - Real Time - where you can see what's happening right now on your cluster (only on dedicated servers),
  - Metrics - where you can explore all the metrics history (more metrics in dedicated servers of course!),
  - Collections - where you can browse your collections and manipulate the data,
  - Command Line Tools - where you can copy/paste the command lines to use MongoDB import/export/dump/restore/top/stats.

> NB: Because you are currently loading the sample dataset, you should see some writes in the *Real Time* and *Metrics* tabs. 

- You are now *almost* ready to work with your new cluster.
- In order to do be *completely* ready, you will need to complete 2 actions in the *Security* tab at the top: 
  - Create a MongoDB User for your cluster because the authentication is ON of course!
  - Whitelist your public IP address because we are in the cloud and it's not an open bar for hackers! If you don't allow your IP address, you won't be able to access your cluster with your machine.
 
 ![Load Sample Dataset](images/security.png)
 
- We will now verify that you can connect correctly to your cluster using [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass).
- Please install the latest version of MongoDB Compass Enterprise from the download center to be able to try all the features.
- To verify that you have correctly setup the MongoDB User and your IP address, try to connect with MongoDB Compass using the 
 *Connect* button and use the MongoDB URI you can copy easily.
 
### MongoDB Compass
 
- Explore MongoDB Compass & visit the different tabs.
 
#### Lab: GeoSpatial
 
- Build a geo spatial query on the `sample_geospatial.shipwrecks` collection using the map you will find in the *Schema* tab. Tips: You can scroll on the map to find the Statue of Liberty then you have to hold Shift + drag your mouse on the map to build a geospatial query.
- How many wrecks are within 10km of the Statue of Liberty?
- Clue : Where is the radius in the query? It's in radian. Find a way to transform 10km in radian [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes/).

  The answer is 66 :-).
</p></details>
 
#### Lab: Aggregation Framework

- Use now the `sample_training.zips` collection.
- Have a look to its content.
- MongoDB uses the Aggregation Framework to manipulate data. 
- Here is an example of an aggregation pipeline which finds the 3 most inhabited states in the USA.

```js
[
  {
    '$group': {
      '_id': '$state', 
      'totalPop': {
        '$sum': '$pop'
      }
    }
  }, {
    '$project': {
      'state': '$_id', 
      'totalPop': 1, 
      '_id': 0
    }
  }, {
    '$sort': {
      'totalPop': -1
    }
  }, {
    '$limit': 3
  }
]
```

- Import this pipeline in MongoDB Compass using the import tool.

![Import pipeline](images/import-pipeline.png)

- Can you change this pipeline to find the 5 biggest cities in the State of New York (NY)?

```js
[
  {
    '$match': {
      'state': 'NY'
    }
  }, {
    '$group': {
      '_id': '$city', 
      'totalPop': {
        '$sum': '$pop'
      }
    }
  }, {
    '$project': {
      'city': '$_id', 
      'totalPop': 1, 
      '_id': 0
    }
  }, {
    '$sort': {
      'totalPop': -1
    }
  }, {
    '$limit': 5
  }
]
```

### MongoDB Stitch

MongoDB Stitch is the serverless platform you can use to build backend services on top of MongoDB Atlas.

Let's build our first mini application with MongoDB Stitch.

#### Lab: Create a Stitch Application

- Click on Stitch on the left side and create a new Stitch application.
- You can use the deployment model *Local* and deploy in *Ireland* to keep it close.
- When you are in your Stitch application, enable the Hosting feature. We will need that for later and the DNS will have time to update.

#### Lab: Create a REST API

We want to create a simple REST API to read and write movie titles to MongoDB.

- Create a new HTTP Service.
- Create an incoming webhook for your POST route and secure your REST API with a *secret as query param*.
- Go to the settings and try the CURL command. If you don't have CURL, use Postman.
- Verify in the *Logs* that you received something.
 
 ![Load Sample Dataset](images/logs.png)
 
- Now let's write the POST body to MongoDB. Replace the function code with this:
```js
exports = function(payload, response) {
  const mongodb = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
  const movies = mongodb.db("stitch").collection("movies");
  var body = EJSON.parse(payload.body.text());
  movies.insertOne(body)
  .then(result => {
    response.setStatusCode(201);
  });
};
```

- Now send your CURL command with the body : `'{"Title":"Titanic"}'`
- Verify in MongoDB Atlas that your new document has been written correctly.
 
![Load Sample Dataset](images/titanic.png)

- Repeat the same operations to implement a GET all titles route.
- Here is [some doc](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/mongodb/actions/collection.find/#finding-all-documents-in-a-collection) to help you.
- Don't forget that this time, you are returning results (cf settings).

<details><summary>Click to see the answer</summary>
 
```js
exports = function() {
  const mongodb = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
  const movies = mongodb.db("stitch").collection("movies");
  return movies.find().toArray();
};
```
</details>

#### Lab: Trigger

Now that we have written our awesome title in MongoDB, we want to enrich our MongoDB document with some extra information about 
this movie.

- Let's create a free account on the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). We will use them as a micro service.
- Once you have the API key, save it as a *Secret Value* in Stitch.

![Load Sample Dataset](images/secret.png)

- Create a Trigger. It will listen to all the inserts and trigger a lambda function each time a document is inserted.
- You will need to create the lambda function. Take some time to read it and use the following code:

```js
exports = function(changeEvent) {
  const docId = changeEvent.documentKey._id;
  const title = encodeURIComponent(changeEvent.fullDocument.Title.trim());
  const movies = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("stitch").collection("movies");
  const apikey = context.values.get("apikey");
  const omdb_url = "http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=" + apikey + "&t=" + title;
  
  return context.http
    .get({ url: omdb_url })
    .then(resp => {
    console.log(resp.body.text());
    var doc = EJSON.parse(resp.body.text());
    if (doc.Response == "False") {
      movies.deleteOne({"_id":docId});
    } else {
      movies.updateOne({"_id":docId}, {$set: doc});
    }
  });
};
```

- Insert a new movie in your collection using the POST route you created earlier.
- Check the result in your collection.

#### Lab: Website

- Now that you have a super smart movie system, it's time to share your finest movies with the world.
- Use the *Hosting* feature of MongoDB Stitch and display the content of your collection.
- Here is a template. Add the missing code to make it work: hunt down the "XXXXXXXXXX"!

</details>

<details><summary>Click to know why it's not working</summary>

It's not working for 2 reasons: 
- Firstly, you need to activate the anonymous authentication which is not enabled by default.
- Secondly, you need to allow the "MongoDB Query Anywhere" feature to read this `stitch.movies` collection we created. By default, nothing is authorised.
</details>

#### Lab: OK I did all of that. What now?

Well first of all: congratz :-) ! Now that you are a MongoDB Stitch pro, it's time to invent your own problem! 

Wait a minute... I'm just kidding. That website you just did is way to simple. I can't even add or delete a movie and I don't have a button to refresh the list!

- Add a button to refresh the list.
- Add an input text box to be able to enter a new movie title and a button to add the title in MongoDB.
- Add a button to remove a movie.

  Not this time! You are on your own buddy!

## Conclusion

I hope you liked this workshop. If you want to see a more advanced "Mini Movie Collection" project, you can have a look on Github: https://github.com/MaBeuLux88/mongodb-stitch-movie-collection.

This solution contains a few extra features: 
- Twilio integration so we can send a movie title by text message with our phone.
- Google OAuth for the authentication.
- Date parsing to ISO Date with a sub function.
- A second trigger is called on the update event (after the document is enriched) to calculate some stats.
- There are scripts leveraging the MongoDB Stitch CLI to help you import this project in your own Stitch Project.
